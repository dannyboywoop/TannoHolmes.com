      Noting that \(V_{out} = V_{k}\), and that the current will be constant throughout the circuit,
        the proportionality of voltage and resistance stated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohms's Law</a> leads to,
        \[
        {V_{out} \over V_{ref}} = {R_k \over R_k + R_T}.
        \]
        This can be rearranged into an equation for \(R_T\) as follows,
        \[
        \begin{align}
        R_k + R_T &= {{R_kV_{ref}} \over {V_{out}}}\\
        R_T &= {{R_kV_{ref}} \over {V_{out}}} - R_k \tag{1}\label{eq:resistance_general}
        \end{align}
        \]
      </p>

          The voltage meaured by the Arduino is converted into a 10 bit ADC value, with 0 representing 0V
          and 1023 representing the reference voltage of 5V. This can be decribed by,
          \[
          ADC = {{V_{out}}\over{V_{ref}}} \times 1023 \tag{2}.
          \]
        Plugging this into equation \eqref{eq:resistance_general} yields,
        \[
        R_T = \left({1023 \over ADC} - 1\right)\cdot R_k \tag{3}\label{eq:resistance}.
        \]

        Now that we have an equation for the resistance of the thermistor, we can attempt convert this into a temperature.
        In an ideal world this would be done by taking measurements at known temperatures, attempting to fit the results to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhart%E2%80%93Hart_equation">Steinhart–Hart equation</a>,
        \[
        {1 \over T} = A + B \ln{R} + C\left(\ln{R}\right)^3,
        \]
        where \(T\) is the temperature in kelvin, R is the resistance in ohms and \(A,B\) and \(C\) are model parameters.
      </p>
        <p>
          As I don't have the equipment to accurately set or measure temperature, I opted to use a simplified equation with only one parameter.
          The equation in question is derived from the Steinhart-Hart equation by setting \(A = \frac{1}{T_0}-\frac{1}{\beta}\ln{R_0},
           B=\frac{1}{\beta}\) and \(C=0\). This leads to,
          \[
          \frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{T_0}+\frac{1}{\beta}\ln{\frac{R}{R_0}} \tag{4}\label{eq:temp},
          \]
          where \(T_0\) is a reference temperature, usually 25°C (298.15 kelvin), \(R_0\) is the resistance of the thermistor
          at the reference temperature and \(\beta\) is the sole model parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equation \eqref{eq:temp} can be used for NTC thermistors, like the one used in this project.
          Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor#NTC">NTC thermistors</a> will quote values for \(\beta, T_0\) and \(R_0\) in their accompanying datasheets.
        </p>
        <p>We can rearrange equation \eqref{eq:temp} into an equation for \(T\) as follows,
          \[
          \begin{align}
          \frac{1}{T} &=\ln{\left(\exp{\frac{1}{T_0}}\right)} + \frac{1}{\beta}\ln{\frac{R}{R_0}}\\
          &=\frac{1}{\beta}\ln{\left(\exp{\frac{\beta}{T_0}}\right)} + \frac{1}{\beta}\ln{\frac{R}{R_0}}\\
          &=\frac{1}{\beta}\ln{\left(\frac{R}{R_0\exp{(\frac{-\beta}{T_0})}}\right)}\\
          T &= \frac{\beta}{\ln{\left(\frac{R}{R_\infty}\right)}} \tag{5}\label{eq:temp_resistance},
          \end{align}
          \]
          where we define \(R_\infty=R_0\exp{(\frac{-\beta}{T_0})}\).
